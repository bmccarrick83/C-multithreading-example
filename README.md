# C# Multithreading example

Check out my C# multithreading code sample. I followed a tutorial by Code Bro at "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbmW4qAh8w".
I created a for loop for two threads. Thread 1 Counts down and i is decremented.
Thread 2 counts up and i is incremented.
When the code is run, both trheads are run concurrently.
Enjoy!
